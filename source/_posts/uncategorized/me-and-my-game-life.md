**Video Games: A Lifelong Journey**

Video games have been a significant part of my life. Recently, I finally finished "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", a modern classic RPG.

Even though I love video games, I haven’t always had much time for them. I’ve played everything from classics like Contra and Ninja Gaiden to iconic PC games like Counter-Strike and Warcraft. I also spent a lot of time on handhelds such as the Game Boy Advance and PSP, getting lost in games like Pokémon and God of War.

Games have always given me hope, happiness, and room to imagine. But they also require time—which I didn’t have much of during school. I would fall in love with a game and then put it down after a few days to get back to studying.

As I grew older, homework turned into work deadlines. After a long day, I rarely had the energy for competitive games like Dota 2 or PUBG. Over time I drifted toward mobile games—partly because building a high-end PC has become prohibitively expensive.

"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" broke that pattern. It pulled me in enough that I spent nearly three months finishing it—my biggest gaming commitment since university.

That summer, I bought a 4K TV and started looking for a console that could make good use of it. I settled on a used Xbox One X, which turned out to be a great fit. I also picked up a few games known to run well at 4K/60 FPS, including "NBA 2K21," "Dirt Rally 2.0," "Titanfall 2," and "Battlefield 5."

Over the next three months, I spent most of my gaming time on "Battlefield 5" and "The Witcher 3." "Battlefield 5" looked great, but the campaign was short and aiming in an FPS with a controller still isn’t my strength, so I moved on quickly. "The Witcher 3", on the other hand, felt right at home on the Xbox: it’s an action RPG, and the controller experience is comfortable.

It may not reinvent the genre, but "The Witcher 3" is still one of the best fantasy games I’ve played. It let me cross vast grasslands and snowy fields, fight monsters with magic and swords, and wander the cobbled streets of medieval cities.

After sinking so many hours into it, I get why people call it a “AAA” game: it’s huge, polished, and clearly built with a lot of time and resources. It asked a lot of me, but it also gave a lot back.

In today’s busy and competitive world, it’s easy to feel guilty about spending time on games. Still, I’m grateful for my Xbox and the games I’ve played on it. They make my life richer, and they’re an important part of how I relax and recharge.
