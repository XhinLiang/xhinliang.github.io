**Video Games: A Lifelong Journey**

Video games have been a significant part of my life. Recently, I completed "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," renowned as one of the world’s most famous RPGs.

Although I love video games, I haven't always dedicated much time to them. My gaming history spans from classic titles like Contra and Ninja Gaiden to iconic PC games such as Counter-Strike and Warcraft. I've also enjoyed portable gaming on devices like the Game Boy Advance and PSP, exploring worlds in games like Pokémon and God of War.

Video games have always offered me hope, happiness, and a boundless imagination. However, they also require time—a resource that was scarce due to my studies. Though I often fell in love with a game, I had to set it aside after a few days to focus on my academics.

As I transitioned into adulthood, my studies gave way to career challenges. After a long day’s work, fatigue often dulled my interest in engaging titles, especially energy-consuming games like Dota 2 and PUBG. These days, I find myself gravitating towards mobile games, as building a high-end PC setup has become prohibitively expensive.

However, "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" broke this pattern. It captivated me enough to invest nearly three months to complete it—my most significant gaming commitment since university.

This summer, I invested in a 4K TV and began searching for a console that would match its capabilities. I settled on a used Xbox One X, which proved to be a perfect fit. I immediately stocked up on games optimized for 4K resolution and 60 FPS, including "NBA 2K21," "Dirt Rally 2.0," "Titanfall 2," and "Battlefield 5."

Over three months, I devoted considerable time to "Battlefield 5" and "The Witcher 3." While "Battlefield 5" impressed with its graphics, its short main storyline and the challenges of FPS gameplay on a wireless controller led me to move on quickly. On the other hand, "The Witcher 3" felt right at home on the Xbox with its immersive action RPG elements and comfortable wireless controller setup.

Despite not being groundbreaking, "The Witcher 3" remains one of the finest fantasy games I've ever experienced. It allowed me to traverse vast grasslands and snowy fields, battle monsters with magic and swords, and wander through the cobbled streets of medieval cities.

After spending substantial time with it, I believe "The Witcher 3" epitomizes the "AAA" game category, which signifies a title developed with significant time, resources, and financial investment. It demanded a lot from me, but also gave much in return.

Some might question the wisdom of investing time in gaming in today's hyper-competitive society. To them, I say I am grateful for my Xbox and its games. They enrich my life, bringing satisfaction and joy through virtual adventures. Games are, without a doubt, an essential part of my life.
